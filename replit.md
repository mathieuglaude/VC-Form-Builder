# Form Builder Pro - VC Integration

## Overview

This is a full-stack TypeScript application that provides a professional form builder with Verifiable Credentials (VC) integration. The system allows administrators to create dynamic forms using a drag-and-drop interface, where form fields can be auto-populated with verified data from digital credentials. The application follows a modern web architecture with React frontend, Express backend, and PostgreSQL database using Drizzle ORM.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui component library
- **State Management**: TanStack React Query for server state management
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Form Building**: Form.io React components (@formio/react) for drag-and-drop form creation

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket server for VC verification notifications
- **API Design**: RESTful API with JSON responses

### Database Layer
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM for PostgreSQL with type-safe schema definitions
- **Database Provider**: Neon serverless PostgreSQL
- **Schema Management**: Drizzle Kit for migrations and schema management

## Key Components

### Form Builder System
- **Interactive Builder**: Drag-and-drop interface using Form.io components
- **Component Library**: Standard form elements (text, email, select, checkbox, textarea, number, datetime)
- **Enhanced Metadata**: Extended form components with VC integration properties
- **Real-time Preview**: Instant form preview during building

### Verifiable Credentials Integration
- **Data Source Types**: 
  - Free Text (manual entry)
  - Pick List (predefined options)
  - Verified Attribute (auto-filled from VC)
- **Proof Requests**: Configurable credential verification requirements
- **Real-time Verification**: WebSocket-based notification system for instant credential verification
- **Auto-population**: Automatic form field population upon successful VC verification

### User Interface Components
- **Form Builder Page**: Administrative interface for creating and editing forms
- **Form Fill Page**: Public interface for form completion with VC integration
- **VC Modal**: Interactive credential verification interface with QR codes and deep links
- **Verified Badge**: Visual indicator for fields verified through VCs

## Data Flow

### Form Creation Flow
1. Admin accesses builder interface
2. Drags components from library to form canvas
3. Configures component properties including VC mappings
4. Saves form configuration to database with metadata
5. Form becomes available for public access

### Form Completion Flow
1. User accesses public form via unique URL
2. System checks for VC requirements and initiates proof request
3. User scans QR code or follows deep link to wallet
4. Wallet presents credentials to verification service
5. WebSocket notifies frontend of successful verification
6. Form fields auto-populate with verified data
7. User completes remaining fields and submits form

### Real-time Verification Flow
1. Frontend establishes WebSocket connection with unique client ID
2. Proof request sent to VC API service
3. User completes verification in wallet app
4. VC API webhook notifies backend of verification
5. Backend broadcasts verification result via WebSocket
6. Frontend receives notification and updates form state
