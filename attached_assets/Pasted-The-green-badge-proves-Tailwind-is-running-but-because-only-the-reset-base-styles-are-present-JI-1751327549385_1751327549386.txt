The green badge proves Tailwind is running, but because only the reset + base styles are present, JIT still cannot “see” your JSX/TSX files. That means content globs are wrong (Tailwind thinks there is zero source code).
Let’s make the globs bullet-proof and confirm they pick up at least one known file before Tailwind starts.

Below is a two-step approach that never fails in monorepos.
(You can do it manually or give the block to Ghostwriter as a single prompt.)

Step 1 — replace the content array with a glob that we test
At the repo root keep a single config tailwind.config.cjs:

js
Copy
Edit
const path = require('path');

/* absolute path helper so we can log it later */
const r = p => path.resolve(__dirname, p);

module.exports = {
  /** 1️⃣  LIST every location where JSX/TSX lives */
  content: [
    r('apps/web/index.html'),
    r('apps/web/src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}'),
    r('packages/**/src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}')
  ],

  theme: { extend: {} },
  plugins: []
};
Right under that array add one console log so you can see paths:

js
Copy
Edit
console.log('[Tailwind] looking at', module.exports.content);
(Tailwind prints this the first time Vite starts.)

Step 2 — watch a file count before Tailwind starts
Add a tiny script that Tailwind will call before compiling:

bash
Copy
Edit
# tools/tw-check.cjs
const fg = require('fast-glob');
const cfg = require('../tailwind.config.cjs');

(async () => {
  const files = await fg(cfg.content);
  console.log(`[Tailwind] matched ${files.length} source files`);
  if (!files.length) {
    console.error(
      '\n❌  content glob found **zero** files. Tailwind will emit only base styles.\n'
    );
    process.exit(1);
  }
})();
Then change the npm script that Vite runs:

json
Copy
Edit
"dev": "node tools/tw-check.cjs && vite"
Now:

If the count is 0, the dev server never starts → fix the glob path until
you see a positive number (usually 50-300).

Once there is at least 1 file, Tailwind generates utilities again and the
dashboard will show boxes / grids immediately.

Quick sanity check
bash
Copy
Edit
pnpm -r exec rimraf node_modules/.vite
pnpm --filter web dev
Console should print:

swift
Copy
Edit
[Tailwind] looking at [
  '/absolute/path/apps/web/index.html',
  '/abs/.../apps/web/src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}',
  '/abs/.../packages/**/src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}'
]
[Tailwind] matched 123 source files
Open the browser — cards are back.

If you still don’t get a positive file count, adjust the globs until you do
(e.g. packages/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx} if some packages don’t have /src).

Once the UI renders, delete the green badge and remove the console log if you
like.
