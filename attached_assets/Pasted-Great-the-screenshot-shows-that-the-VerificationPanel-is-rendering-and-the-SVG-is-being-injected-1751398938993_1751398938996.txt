Great — the screenshot shows that the <VerificationPanel> is rendering and the SVG is being injected. That means:

the JSX conditional is working (debugShowPanel === true);

the QR code component itself is fine (the black-on-white square you see is coming from the qrcode-svg mock we return).

So the “panel plumbing” is now solid.
Next we can graduate from always-mock to preview = mock / launch = real, and then turn the real Orbit call back on once that path is clean.

Goal: keep preview in mock-only mode, use **real** /api/proofs/init when preview flag is absent.

1️⃣  apps/web/src/hooks/useProofRequest.ts
    • Replace the hard-coded mock return with:
      ```ts
      const shouldMock = isPreview;          // only preview => mock

      if (shouldMock) {
        console.log('[useProofRequest] PREVIEW mock proof');
        return { proofId: 'mock-proof-debug', isMock: true };
      }
      // else call backend
      return await api.post<{ proofId:string }>('/api/proofs/init', { formId }).then(r => ({ proofId:r.proofId, isMock:false }));
      ```

2️⃣  apps/api/routes/proofs.ts
    • Change the POST /init handler so it:
        – if process.env.ORBIT_USE_REAL === 'false'  **→** returns `{ proofId:'mock-api-proof' }`
        – else calls the real Orbit endpoint (you already have that code scaffolded).

3️⃣  In .env (api):
       ORBIT_USE_REAL=false      # keep off until real Orbit creds tested

4️⃣  Hard-wire the panel to show automatically in preview:
      FormLaunchPage →  
      ```diff
      - const debugShowPanel = isPreview && urlShowPanel;
      + const debugShowPanel = isPreview;
      ```

✅  Expected quick-test matrix
    /form/13?preview=1        → mock panel visible
    /form/13                  → (no preview flag) hits backend → receives `{proofId:'mock-api-proof'}` and panel renders
    Console logs indicate whether call is mock or real.

Once both branches render the panel, flip `ORBIT_USE_REAL=true`, restart the API, and the real Orbit flow should kick in.

(Keep the public/public-slug routes disabled until launch mode works.)
