🔧  BUG – Publish Form always says “URL taken”                    (high-severity)
==========================================================================

🪧  Symptoms
-----------
• Any slug entered in the “Publish Form” modal (e.g. `kyc-test`, `hello`) is
  marked “taken” and the Publish button stays disabled.

• Network tab: the GET/POST request that checks slug availability returns
  `{ available:false }` for every value.

• DB contains no published_forms row with those slugs.

🥅  Expected
-----------
• Slug is considered **taken** only when a *different* form already owns it.
• Otherwise `{ available:true }` and user can publish.
• A unique DB constraint prevents races.

🚩  What to inspect
-------------------
1. **API route**  
   `apps/api/routes/forms.ts` (or `publish.ts`) has the slug-lookup handler
   e.g.  
   ```ts
   router.get('/slug/:slug/available', async (req,res)=>{ … })
Verify the query:

ts
Copy
Edit
const exists = await db.form.findFirst({
  where:{ publicSlug: slug }          // should NOT filter by owner
});
res.json({ available: !exists });
Remove accidental filter AND userId = req.user.id.

Database
• form_configs (or published_forms) table has public_slug column.
• Create / ensure a UNIQUE INDEX on public_slug.

sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_form_public_slug
  ON form_configs (public_slug);
Publish endpoint
POST /api/forms/:id/publish must:

validate body.slug,

upsert {id, publicSlug, publishedAt},

return { publicUrl }.

Catch UniqueViolation and respond 409.

Frontend
apps/web/src/pages/FormBuilderPro/PublishModal.tsx

debounce fetch to /slug/${slug}/available

show ✓ green if available, red error otherwise.

enable Publish when available === true.

Tests & QA
• pnpm test:e2e publish-slug
• manual: try “abc”, “abc” again → second fails.

🔨 Tasks
 Fix backend availability route (point 1)

 Add DB unique index / migration (point 2)

 Harden publish controller (point 3)

 Wire frontend validation (point 4)

 Regression tests

No other files should be touched. pnpm dev must restart with 0 TS errors
and publishing a new slug like kyc-test should succeed, returning
https://<hostname>/f/kyc-test.
