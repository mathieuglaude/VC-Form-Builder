Tailwind is loading (green badge proves it) but the utilities used by your
components are not being emitted because Purge / JIT is still looking at the
old folder structure.
Only the class names that appear in src/index.css (text-green-600,
font-bold) survive, while those coming from JSX (grid, rounded-lg,
bg-slate-50 …) are purged.

Prompt – update Tailwind content globs to new monorepo + verify output
Copy everything between the lines into tailwind_content_fix_prompt.txt and
feed it to Replit AI.

**Task – emit all utilities after monorepo move**

### 1 · Single Tailwind config at repo root

1. Move `apps/web/tailwind.config.js` → `tailwind.config.cjs` in repo root.
2. Delete the local file in `apps/web/`.

### 2 · Correct `content` array for the whole workspace

```js
module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./apps/web/index.html",
    "./apps/web/src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
    "./packages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}"
  ],
  theme: { extend: {} },
  plugins: []
};
No leading . on glob paths and no quotes around the braces after Vite 4.

3 · Tell Vite where to find the config
In apps/web/vite.config.ts add:

ts
Copy
Edit
import { resolve } from 'path';
export default defineConfig({
  plugins:[react()],
  css:{ postcss:{ config: resolve(__dirname,'../../postcss.config.cjs') } }
});
4 · Clean and rebuild
bash
Copy
Edit
pnpm -r exec rimraf node_modules/.vite
pnpm --filter web dev
5 · Verify in browser devtools
Open Network tab → localhost:5173/src/index.css.
Search for .grid{display:grid} and .rounded-lg{border-radius:
If both exist, utilities are back.

6 · Remove the green badge
Delete the temporary <div className="test-tailwind-loaded …"/>
and the .test-tailwind-loaded rule.

Ghostwriter instructions
• Move config, update content array, Vite css.postcss.path, clean cache.
• Reload page: cards must have rounded white boxes.
• Confirm .grid and .rounded-lg are present in delivered CSS (log a snippet).
• Remove test badge lines.
• Commit “fix: Tailwind content glob for monorepo”.

**Why this works**

* The global config at repo root is the only file Tailwind will pick up; Vite’s
  PostCSS loader needs its absolute path when the file is outside `apps/web`.
* Globs now include every `packages/**` file where your components live, so JIT
  keeps the utility classes.
* Cleaning `.vite` cache forces Vite to rebuild CSS with the new config.

After this run your UI should show proper grids, borders, gradients – no more
unstyled text.
