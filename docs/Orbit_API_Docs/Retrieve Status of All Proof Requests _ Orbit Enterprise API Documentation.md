# Retrieve Status of All Proof Requests

TheRetrieve Status of All Proof Requests APIretrieves all proof requests that have been sent to a Wallet, or Credential Holder, but the Holder has not yet responded with either a decline or a credential presentation. The proof requests are listed in chronological order, with the proof request whose state was created/updated most recently appearing at the top if the list. 

If you include a specific 'state' in the Request Body, you can also retrieve all pending proof requests that match only the state(s) you included.

Descriptions of each state are included below:

- generated: Indicates that the proof request has been created and shared with the requesting LOB

- scanned: QR code has been scanned by the holder’s wallet

- proof-recd: Proof has been received by the Verifier Agent from the holder’s wallet

- success: Verification of the proof shared by the holder’s wallet has been successfully verified by the Verifier Agent.

- revoked: Verification of the proof shared by the holder’s wallet has failed as the credential shared by the holder has been revoked by the Issuer.

- verification-failed: Verification of the proof shared by the holder’s wallet failed due to an error.
