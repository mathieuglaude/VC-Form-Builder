# Prepare URL for Proof Request (Without A Proof Definition ID)

ThePrepare URL for Proof Request (Without A Proof Definition ID) APIenables the LOB to receive a URL-based proof request, which can then be sent as an out-of-band proof request. This URL will be created based on the protocol specified. The client can determine how the URL is sent to the intended recipient of the proof request.

### The Prepare URL for Proof Request API is called to prepare a URL-based proof request

UUID received upon LOB registration

The protocol in which the message should be sent and is specified by the sender of the message

A unique identifier for the client credential proof. If not provided, a new UUID will be generated automatically.

Specifies whether the proof verification process should be performed automatically upon fetching the proof definition.

Flag indicating whether the claim is being created. Set to true to initiate the claim creation process.

List of credential attributes for which values are requested from the holderâ€™s wallet

List of requested predicates (if applicable)

Provide a name for the proof request

Provide a purpose for the proof request

Proof Request format can be ANONCRED, JSONLD or OID4VC

To create request verification authority
